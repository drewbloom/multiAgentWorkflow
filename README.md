### Multi-Agent Workflow Demo

## Goals
- Use common Python dependencies to connect together multiple AI agents
- Include tool use that allows those agents to engage in semantic search and make SQL queries
- Use a test database to test operations
- Deploy simple frontends for testing different interactions with the agents

## Setup
- Must use a SQLite database or db file
- app folder contains deployments
- agents folder contains the agent setups
- database folder contains the database and scripting for interacting with it
* This may be all be migrated into utils.py once an appropriate setup is determined
